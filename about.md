Hi, I'm Rohan.

I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer working on enabling ML models to run on edge devices with Qualcomm. I did my masters from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore where I developed foundation in Machine Learning and Deep Learning while developing automated rare disease identification systems processing millions of data points as master thesis with Prof. Rajesh Sunderasan. During masters I did intern in Gojek (Singapore) working on building production-ready image moderation system.([Intern Work](https://medium.com/the-algorithmic-minds/how-to-moderate-images-based-on-text-and-logo-using-ml-dl-f48a7ef173ac))

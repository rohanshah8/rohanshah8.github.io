Hi, I'm **Rohan Shah** 👋

## What I Do

I'm a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer**  working on enabling ML/DL models to run efficiently on edge devices. My focus is on optimizing deep learning models for mobile, automotive & IOT, making AI accessible and practical for every devices locally.

## Background

I completed my **Master's degree from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore**, where I developed a strong foundation in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My master's thesis focused on developing automated rare disease identification systems that processed millions of data points, working under the guidance of Prof. Rajesh Sunderasan.

## Experience

### Qualcomm
Currently working on cutting-edge ML optimization techniques for edge devices, including:
- Model quantization and compression
- Post-mortem analysis of every op inside the model graph
- Real-time inference optimization
- Power-efficient ML deployment
- AI Orchestrator for LLM to build RAG System, Agents and complex workflows & executing locally on-device

### Gojek
During my master's program, I interned at Gojek where I built a production-ready image moderation system. This experience taught me valuable lessons about taking ML from research to production.

**Read about my work**: [How to Moderate Images Based on Text and Logo Using ML/DL](https://medium.com/the-algorithmic-minds/how-to-moderate-images-based-on-text-and-logo-using-ml-dl-f48a7ef173ac)

## Interests

I'm passionate about:
- **Edge AI** - Making machine learning practical for resource-constrained devices
- **Production ML** - Building reliable, scalable ML systems
- **Deep Learning** - Exploring new architectures and optimization techniques

## Connect

I'd love to connect and discuss ML, edge computing, or anything tech-related!

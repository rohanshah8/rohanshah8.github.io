Hi, I'm **Rohan Shah** 👋

## What I Do

I'm a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer** at Qualcomm, where I work on enabling ML models to run efficiently on edge devices. My focus is on optimizing deep learning models for mobile and embedded systems, making AI accessible and practical for everyday devices.

## Background

I completed my **Master's degree from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore**, where I developed a strong foundation in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My master's thesis focused on developing automated rare disease identification systems that processed millions of data points, working under the guidance of Prof. Rajesh Sunderasan.

## Experience

### Qualcomm
Currently working on cutting-edge ML optimization techniques for edge devices, including:
- Model quantization and compression
- Hardware-aware neural architecture search
- Real-time inference optimization
- Power-efficient ML deployment

### Gojek (Singapore)
During my master's program, I interned at Gojek where I built a production-ready image moderation system. This experience taught me valuable lessons about taking ML from research to production.

**Read about my work**: [How to Moderate Images Based on Text and Logo Using ML/DL](https://medium.com/the-algorithmic-minds/how-to-moderate-images-based-on-text-and-logo-using-ml-dl-f48a7ef173ac)

## Interests

I'm passionate about:
- **Edge AI** - Making machine learning practical for resource-constrained devices
- **Production ML** - Building reliable, scalable ML systems
- **Deep Learning** - Exploring new architectures and optimization techniques
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Writing about my experiences and learnings

## Connect

I'd love to connect and discuss ML, edge computing, or anything tech-related!
